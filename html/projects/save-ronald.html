	<section class="text">
		<p>Save Ronald is a platformer game that I've worked on in 2020 and 2021. It's made with Godot Engine 3.</p>
		<p>It takes inspiration from games like Commander Keen, which means that it features rather difficult levels with limited ammo and platforming challenges with various enemies.</p>
		<p>It has 8 levels in total, 7 platforming challenges and one bossfight. The game also has a neat time trial mode, which allows you
			to speedrun individual levels, or the entire game, and compete with your friends for the fastest times.</p>
		<p>In addition to this all, the game features an original soundtrack by Tamkish. It's awesome and I like it a lot.</p>
		<p>I had many more plans for this project, but alas, life often doesn't work out the way we anticipate it to. I don't expect I'll ever come back to it and finish it, unfortunately.</p>
		<p>The game is free to download on its Itch.io page: <a href="https://oschl.itch.io/save-ronald" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oschl.itch.io/save-ronald</a><br>
		You can also listen to (and buy) the soundtrack here: <a href="https://tamkish.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tamkish.bandcamp.com/</a></p>
