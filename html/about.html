	<h2>about me</h2>
	<section class="text">
		<p>There really isn't that much to learn here, sorry.</p>
		<p>I was born in 2004 in the town of Havlíčkův Brod, and I've spent my entire life living in the Czech capital, Prague.</p>
		<p>I was always interested in computers and software, so I decided to go to a high school that teaches computer science. That is what I'm studying now.
			I am regretting the decision only occasionally.</p>
		<p>In addition to programming, I am also rather good at languages, especially English. If you find any mistakes on this website, it's because
			my cat stepped on my keyboard.</p>
		<p>I am a dog person.</p>
		<p>In my free time, I also play the piano and sing, but if you ask me about it, I will pretend I have never heard of the concept of music before.</p>
		<p>That's it. Again, sorry.</p>
